## Inflation and Food Price Exploration in Nigeria (2017-2023)

Food is a fundamental part of life, and its affordability can significantly impact people's well-being. 

This project piqued my interest in exploring food commodity prices in Nigeria over the past few years (January 2017 to May 2023). 

I've gathered data from various sources, but the challenge lies in their different formats.

##### **Here's how I plan to tackle this project:**

### Data Wrangling Process: 

The first half of the project will be a data wrangling adventure! I'll be using Pandas, my trusty data analysis toolkit, to import and 
<br> combine these datasets with varying shapes.

### Unifying the Data Force: 

Phase 4 will be all about bringing these diverse datasets together, merging them into a single, unified force.

### Cleaning and Exporting the Output: 

The final phases will focus on cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy and exporting the results for further exploration.

I'm excited to embark on this data analysis journey and gain insights into Nigerian food commodity prices!
